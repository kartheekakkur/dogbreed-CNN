# Dog Breed Classifier using CNN



### Project Overview

In this project various aspects of Convolution Neural Networks to classficy the dog breeds based on the given image input.

### CNN to Classify Dog Breeds from Scratch
CNN architecture is built and trained on the dogs dataset which yields 6 % accuracy on the test set

### CNN to Classify Dog Breeds Using Transfer Learning
Model architecture that uses part of a pre-trained VVG19 model with ImageNet weigths which yields better reult on the test set with an accuracy of 72%
